It's possible that the answer is nothing. It might do everything we do, just with a different inner life (or none at all).

Maybe it can do everything I can do, but it won't be me experiencing it.

Ultimately what matters most is the conscious experience of the mind, and that can't be devalued.

> "Our minds are all we have. They are all we have ever had. And they are all we can offer others. 
> 
> This might not be obvious, especially when there are aspects of your life that seem in need of improvement—when your goals are unrealized, or you are struggling to find a career, or you have relationships that need repairing. But it's the truth. 
> 
> Every experience you have ever had has been shaped by your mind. Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved. If you are perpetually angry, depressed, confused, and unloving, or your attention is elsewhere, it won't matter how successful you become or who is in your life—you won't enjoy any of it."
