1. **There is an underlying physical reality.**

   Bodies age. Gravity works. Evolution happened. Science converges because constraints are strong. Physics, biology, chemistry, these are not optional and reality pushes back.

2. **The mind necessarily models physical reality.**

   We never encounter "raw reality." The brain compresses, predicts, filters, and interprets. That is not a flaw, it's just how cognition works and is unavoidable.

3. **Modeling always generates surplus.**

   When we encounter a fact, we don't just register it. We generate images, emotional tones, narratives, implications for identity. None of that is contained in the bare fact itself, but is **always** coupled to it when the system processes the fact. If there is experience, there is this surplus.

4. **Emptiness reveals that this layer is fabricated.**

   Meditating on emptiness does not deny facts. It reveals that the solidity we attribute to our interpretations, meanings, and identities is not inherent, but fabricated by the modeling process.

5. **Seeing fabrication creates maneuvering room.**

   If interpretation is fabricated, it can be adjusted (within real constraints).

6. **Orientation becomes intentional rather than automatic.**

      Once you see how modeling works, you can ask: Given the constraints, which view is skillful? Which reduces unnecessary suffering? Which fosters clarity rather than rigidity? You become less trapped by whichever view happens to be running.
