1. **There is an underlying physical reality.**

   Bodies age. Gravity works. Evolution happened. Science converges because constraints are strong. Physics, biology, chemistry, these are not optional and reality pushes back.

2. **The mind necessarily models those constraints.**

   We never encounter "raw reality." The brain compresses, predicts, filters, and interprets. That is not a flaw, it's just how cognition works and is unavoidable.

3. **Modeling always generates surplus.**

   When we encounter a fact, we don't just register it. We generate images, emotional tones, narratives, implications for identity. None of that is contained in the bare fact itself, but is always coupled to it when the system processes the fact. If there is experience, there is this surplus.

4. **Emptiness reveals that this layer is fabricated.**

   Meditating on emptiness does not deny facts. It does not erase physics or biology. It reveals that the solidity we attribute to our interpretations, meanings, and identities is not inherent, but fabricated by the modeling process.

5. **Seeing fabrication creates maneuvering room.**

   If interpretation is fabricated, it can be adjusted (within real constraints). The modeling machine cannot be turned off. But it is flexible.

6. **Orientation becomes intentional rather than automatic.**

   Once you see how modeling works, you can ask:
    - Given the constraints, which framing is skillful?
    - Which stance reduces unnecessary suffering?
    - Which interpretation fosters clarity rather than rigidity?

   You become less trapped by whichever view happens to be running.
