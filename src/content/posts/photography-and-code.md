Unlike natural language where many things are implied, code must spell out every detail. AI bridges this gap, you can be conversational and let it fill in the precise implementation details.

If you're a good designer, or have great engineering intuition, or are new to coding or a specific framework AI lets you build so much more, so much easier. You no longer need years of coding knowledge to bring your ideas to life.

It allows different types of people to build interesting software. Like how many great street photographers were failed painters who lacked the discipline for methodical craft, but had the creativity to make great visual art.

I left dev despite being successful because the traditional workflow didn't click (too restless, needed more creative flow). Now with AI, I've switched from 10% to 90% of my time coding again. It's finally fun.
