A generation of 90s kids inspired to be engineers by the magic of wholesome game boy tech, only to grow up and inherit this absolute mess.

| Dimension                 | 90s Tech — Finite Use                                         | Current Tech — Continuous Extraction                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interaction Boundary**  | Clear start and end. You turn it on, you turn it off.         | No real boundary. Feeds refresh. Notifications pull you back.                 |
| **Attention**             | Mostly voluntary. You decide to engage.                       | Partially adversarial. Systems compete for your attention continuously.       |
| **Ownership**             | You own the object (cartridge, CD, device).                   | Access over ownership. Subscriptions, cloud dependence.                       |
| **Update Cycle**          | Static product. It works the same tomorrow.                   | Constant updates. Interface and rules shift under you.                        |
| **Psychological Load**    | Low background cognitive demand.                              | Persistent low-level cognitive occupation (badges, alerts, unfinished feeds). |
| **Social Comparison**     | Limited exposure. Local social environment dominates.         | Global comparison engine. Metrics (likes, followers, views).                  |
| **Temporal Experience**   | Slower. Waiting built into system (dial-up, loading screens). | Immediate. Friction minimized. Impulse loop shortened.                        |
| **Identity Formation**    | Tech as hobby or tool.                                        | Tech as environment. Identity performed and measured digitally.               |
| **Economic Role of User** | Customer.                                                     | Customer + product (data, attention).                                         |
| **Resilience**            | Boredom tolerated. Offline default.                           | Boredom eliminated. Online default.                                           |
