Most people I know who made real progress in meditation report the same pattern: meditation went fine, then they did therapy (seemingly unrelated), then meditation became transformative.

I think this is about that nonverbal, felt shift in internal orientation that makes emotions flow differently and changes how you see everything. Once you find that subtle attitude, you can access it deliberately.

Therapy explores these shifts through imaginal work, while meditation is raw experience. Like when you get so good at metta you can invoke the feeling without the phrases.

Imaginal work being like in IFS: how you imagine some parts and test these emotional shifts to talk to them. But all forms of psychotherapy work this way. The only difference is the degree to which they acknowledge this imaginal nature (CBT more dualistic, IFS less).
