Meditation Tycoon, Roller Coaster Tycoon but you're building a meditation retreat center.

Build meditation halls, gardens, tea rooms, hire teachers (strict monk, gentle teacher, weird mystic), manage guests mental states (calm, restless, sleepy, blissful).

Noisy tourists wander in, mosquito season destroys everyone's concentration, student has existential crisis during silent breakfast.
