I like that quote from Sam Harris where he says meditation isn't inherently Buddhist any more than physics is Christian.

Agree about Yuval, but I think Harris has had key insights into emptiness and no-self. However, his worldview causes these insights to manifest in ways that diverge from traditional Buddhist archetypes, which I see as a positive.
