I've been working through a thought experiment after a jhana sit: 

If a human brain were kept alive with zero sensory or bodily input/output (a floating brain) could it still feel emotions, or would it only have thoughts?

I think we lack good terminology to distinguish emotion-as-feeling (phenomenology, what it's like) from emotion-as-control-system (what it does: mental image generation, attention modulation, thought patterns). But the distinction matters here.

My intuition is that emotion-as-feeling would largely disappear in the floating brain scenario. What would remain are cognitive dynamics rather than visceral tone, valence without somatic signature. Something like "algorithmic suffering".

Instead of "I feel awful in my body," it's "my mind is stuck in loops I can't interrupt" (think severe rumination states). Anxiety wouldn't feel like tightness or racing heart, but more like variations in mental restlessness or speed.

Uncontrollable sad thoughts the mind wants to push away but can't. It would have a fundamentally different texture from what we normally call feeling.

This matters to me because I'm quite confident the metta I so dearly cherish is primarily emotion-as-feeling. Something genuinely felt in the body, far more decoupled from the mind's control systems (mental images, automatic thought patterns) than we typically assume.

If the floating brain thought experiment holds, it suggests these somatic feelings aren't just epiphenomena of mental states but constitute something essential about certain emotional experiences.
