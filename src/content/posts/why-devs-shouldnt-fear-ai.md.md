I think a good way to reason about where AI coding is headed, is to look at things we build where the tools are so capable that we can focus almost entirely on the creative aspects.

Gamemaker gave us hotline miami, undertale, hyper light drifter, nuclear throne, all made by people who didn't know how to "code". Garageband gave us Grimes.

It didn't disrupt AAA games, it broadened the landscape of what games could be (middle way being something like Expedition 33 with UE or Disco Elysium).

Unity was never seen as a threat to game devs. They knew their day-to-day jobs could change, but their knowledge and expertise would still be required.

Devs fear AI because they see themselves as bricklayers, just translating requirements into code. But they're actually designers working at the system level, making architectural decisions that deeply shape the experience in ways PMs and product designers often can't even see.
