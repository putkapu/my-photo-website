I'm not worried about companies hiring fewer junior developers, I don't think it will create a talent shortage.

The people who will be truly great at software development in the near future will only partially resemble today's senior developers. There's some overlap, but the core traits and skills will be different.

This new kind of professional is basically a 'mutant' compared to current devs. Similar in some ways, but with specific adaptations that allow them to thrive in the emerging environment.

And once this transition stabilizes and the environment fully shifts, we'll start seeing juniors of this new profession entering the market in a more structured / deliberate way.
