I wonder what humanity will focus on in the post-enlightenment era (after ASI-facilitation).

First hypothesis is that we'll engage in creative exploration of perception / soul-making / consciousness artistry.

Deliberately crafting and exploring novel ways of experiencing reality, similar to how artists today explore new forms of aesthetic expression, but operating at the level of fundamental experience itself.

After discovering the jhanas, I couldn't help but feel that we barely scratched the surface of possible experiential states.

The act of experiencing appears to be our most fundamental activity, inherently meaningful. We are the universe experiencing itself.
