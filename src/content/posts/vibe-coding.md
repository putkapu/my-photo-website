I think vibe coding is fundamentally different from coding, it favors a different kind of person, with different strengths and personality profile. Like when photography was invented, the people who excelled weren't necessarily painters.

The skills that matter seem different: high tolerance for ambiguity, strong product/design intuition over implementation precision, comfort with iteration and black-box tools. Traditional programmer virtues (detail focus, need for control) might even create friction.

We need to wait for this new class of professionals/artists/vibe coders to emerge and show us what excellence looks like. Bottom-up discovery rather than top-down curriculum design.
