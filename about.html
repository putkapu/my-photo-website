			<h2>Hi, I'm Ruan</h2>
			<p>A multidisciplinary professional based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I hold an Engineers Degree in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina and work as a Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in designing and engineering data products.</p>
			
			<p>As a photographer, I find profound joy in visually expressing myself, transcending the limitations of words. From analog to phone and digital photography, I love the process of capturing the world around me.</p>
			
			<p>Beyond my professional and creative pursuits, I have a deep interest in the realms of meditation and psychedelics. I believe that these fields hold immense potential to not only provide a broad-spectrum cure for trauma in the short term but also allow us to access the vast world within ourselves in the long run.</p>
			
			<p>I am open to collaborations, exhibitions, and other opportunities related to photography, as I appreciate the chance to share my work and connect with other artists.</p>
			
			<p>Feel free to use my photos and <a href="mailto:ruan.fp@gmail.com" class="about-link">contact me</a> if our passions align.</p>
